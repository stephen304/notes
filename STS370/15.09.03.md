# The Binomial Distribution
* A RV that has 2 outcomes is binomial
* Four Rules
  1. Only 2 outcomes
      * Usually labeled success and failure
      * Success isn't always good - like counting heart attacks
  2. Fixed number of trials
      * Labeled N
  3. Trials must be independent
      * Trials cannot affect each other
  4. The probability of success is constant
      * For every trial
      * $P(success) = p$
      * $P(failure) = 1 - p = q$
* If $y$ is binomial with $n$ trials and probability $p$
  * We write $y \sim bin(n, p)$
* Example:
  * Scenario
    * Determine if the scenario is a binomial experiment
    * Every student in class rolls a die
    * Records whether it's a one, two, or something else
  * Rules:
    1. There are 3 outcomes
* Example:
  * Scenario:
    * Every student rolls a 6 sided die
    * Record if they got 5
  * Rules:
    1. There are 2 groups, success(5) and failure (not 5)
    2. Trials are fixed
    3. Trials don't affect each other
    4. Probability is fixed at 1/6
  * Result: $y \sim bin(68, {1\over6})$
* Binomial Probability
  * $f(y) = {n \choose y}P^y q^{n-y}$
* Example:
  * Scenario:
    * Take a sample of 50 bars
    * Test tensile strength
    * Expect 1.5% defective
    * 4 are defective
  * Compute
    * $\mu = np = (50)(0.015)$
    * $\sigma = \sqrt{(npq)} = \sqrt{(0.75)(0.985)} = 0.8595$
    * $P(4) = {50 \choose 4} (0.015)^4 (0.985)^{46} = 0.0058$
    * These failures are unlikely
    * $P(\leq 4) = $ Add up 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
