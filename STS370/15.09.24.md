# Confidence Intervals
## Ideal Conditions
* Usually some statistic +- margin of error
* Critical Value
  * $Z_\alpha$ or $Z_{\alpha\over2}$ CV controls the width of the CI through the confidence level
    * Subscript is the probability of the tail of the distribution
    * $Z_{\alpha \over 2}$ is a positive Z-score that has area $\alpha \over 2$ in the upper tail
  * This controls the precision (same as CI width)
* Each statistic has its own standard error
  * Eg err of $\bar{y} = {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}$
* Margin of error controls
  * Variablility
  * Precision through the CV

## Practical Conditions
* Replace sigma with $s$ (the sample standard deviation)
  * Can't use z-scores anymore
  * Use t-scores instead
* Margin of error = $\bar{y}$ +- $t_{\alpha \over 2} (\nu)({s \over \sqrt{n}})$

## T-Distribution
* Similar to normal
  * $(-\infty, \infty)$
  * Unimodal
* One parameter: $\nu$ = degrees of freedom
* As $\nu$ -> $\infty$, $t$ -> $z$
* Noted as $X \sim t(\nu)$
