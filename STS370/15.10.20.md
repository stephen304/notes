# Errors
* Type 1 Error: $H_0$ is true but it was rejected (Probability of this is $\alpha$)
* Type 2 Error: $H_01$ is true but $H_0$ was not rejected (Probability of this is $\beta$)
* Power: Probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false
  1. To increase power, decrease $\beta$
    * Decrease $\beta$ by increasing $\alpha$
  2. Can also increase sample size
  3. Decrease the population standard deviation
