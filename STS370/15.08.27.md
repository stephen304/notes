# Discrete Random Variables (RV)
* Random Variable: Real value function where domain is the sample space (S) and codomain (possible outputs) is $\mathbb{R}$ and range is all actual outputs
  * Is discrete if it has at most countable infinity number of inputs
  * Otherwise it's continuous
  * Denoted by a capital letter
  * Single values of the RV denoted by a lowercase letter
* The Probability Mass Function of a Discrete RV
  * PMF is any function that gives the probability of every possible value of the RV

$y$   |  0  |  1  |  2
------|-----|-----|----
$f(y)$| 1/4 | 1/2 | 1/4

* Support of the RV
  * The set of values where $f(y) > 0$
* Example:
  * $f(y) = ({1 \over 2})^{2y} + {1 \over 24}$; $y = {1 \over 2}, 1, {3 \over 2}$
  * pmf and support
* Example:
  * Let $Y$ be a RV with the following pmf

$y$    |   -1   |    0   |    1   |    2   |    5   |   12  
-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------
$f(y)$ | $0.01$ | $0.10$ | $0.20$ | $0.09$ | $0.50$ | $0.10$
  * Support is $y$

* PMF Rules
  * $0 \leq f(y) \leq 1$
  * $\sum\limits_{y} f(y) = 1$

* Example:
  * LA health center tested water for 2 toxins
  * 10% of sites were clean
  * 30% had atrazine
  * 85% had perchlorate
  * $y$ is the number of toxins in the sample
  * Give the pmf
  * Can solve 1 with $P(A \cap B^c)$ and $P(B \cap A^c)$

$y$    |  0  |  1  |  2
-------|-----|-----|-----
$f(y)$ | 10% | 65% | 25%
