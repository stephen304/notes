# Parameter Overview
* $\mu$ -> $\bar{x}, \bar{y}$
* $\sigma$ -> $s$
* $p$ -> $\hat{p}$

# Confidence Intervals for P
* $\hat{p} = {success \over trials}$
* $\hat{p} {+\over-} Z_{\alpha \over 2} \sqrt{pq \over n}$
  * Since we don't know $p$, we use $\hat{p}$
* Conditions for P
  * Data is from an SRS or Random Experiment
  * Distribution of $\hat{p}$ is approximately normal
    * (At least 10 successes and failures in the sample)
* Called the Wald Confidence Interval for $P$
  * Simple to compute
  * But not accurate
    * Increasing N may not help

# Calculating N for MOE
* For $\mu$
  * $n \geq {Z_{\alpha \over 2}^2 \sigma^2 \over MOE^2}$
* For $P$
  * $n \geq {Z_{\alpha \over 2}^2 pq \over MOE^2}$
