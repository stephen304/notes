# Hypothesis Testing
* Used to assess which of 2 claims is more likely with a sample
* P-Value: Probability
* Steps:
  * Hypothesis:
    * What's our claim
    * What parameter are we interested in?
  * Mechanics:
    * What test are we using?
    * What conditions are required?
    * What calculations do we need?
  * Conclusion:
    * What decision can we make?
    * What does it mean?
* Hypothesis Testing for a Single Mean ($\mu$)
  * There are always 2 hypotheses (must be complimentary):
    * Null hypothesis: $H_0$
    * Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$
  * We always start assuming $H_0$ is true
  * Types of tests:
    * Right tailed: Alternative hypothesis is > x
    * Left tailed: Alternative hypothesis is < x
    * Two tailed: Alternative hypothesis is < and > x
* Assume:
  * $H_0$ is true
  * SRS or Random Experiment
  * Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$ is normal
  * $\sigma$ is known
* State a significance level - A predefined value ($\alpha$) to which we compare our p value
* Collect data
* Check conditions
* Compute a test statistic - A single value computed based on the sample data and the hypothesized value of the parameter
* Compute a P value
  * Ideal: $Z = {\bar{x}-\mu_0 \over {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}} \sim N(0,1)$
  * Practical: $t = {\bar{x}-\mu_0 \over {s \over \sqrt{n}}} \sim t(v)$ where $v=n-1$
  * $\mu_0$ is the hypothesized/null value for $\mu$, also called the boundary value
* Interpreting the results - 2 possibilities:
  1. Our data is representative of the population, but it's not consistent with $H_0$
  2. Our data is not representative of the population, so we can't determine if it's inconsistent with $H_0$
* Making a Decision
  1. Reject the null hypothesis
  2. Fail to reject the null hypothesis
  * Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is lower than the significance level ($\alpha$), $0.05$ by default
