# Hypothesis Testing
* Used to assess which of 2 claims is more likely with a sample
* P-Value: Probability
* Steps:
  * Hypothesis:
    * What's our claim
    * What parameter are we interested in?
  * Mechanics:
    * What test are we using?
    * What conditions are required?
    * What calculations do we need?
  * Conclusion:
    * What decision can we make?
    * What does it mean?
* Hypothesis Testing for a Single Mean ($\mu$)
  * There are always 2 hypotheses (must be complimentary):
    * Null hypothesis: $H_0$
    * Alternative hypothesis: $H_1$
  * We always start assuming $H_0$ is true
  * Types of tests:
    * Right tailed: Alternative hypothesis is > x
    * Left tailed: Alternative hypothesis is < x
    * Two tailed: Alternative hypothesis is < and > x
* Mechanics:
  * Assume:
    * $H_0$ is true
    * SRS or Random Experiment
    * Sampling Distribution of $\bar{x}$ is normal
    * $\sigma$ is known
  * State a significance level - A predefined value ($\alpha$) to which we compare our p value
  * Collect data
  * Check conditions
  * Compute a test statistic - A single value computed based on the sample data and the hypothesized value of the parameter
  * Compute a P value
    * Ideal: $Z = {\bar{x}-\mu_0 \over {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}} \sim N(0,1)$
    * Practical: $t = {\bar{x}-\mu_0 \over {s \over \sqrt{n}}} \sim t(v)$ where $v=n-1$
    * $\mu_0$ is the hypothesized/null value for $\mu$, also called the boundary value
