# Statistical Inference
* Two methods: Estimation or Hypothesis Testing (We do both usually)
* We focus on inferences of 2 parameters
  * $\mu$: mean ($\bar{y}$ we estimate with mean)
  * $p$: population proportion ($\hat{p}$ we estimate with )
* Each scenario
  * Has different conditions
  * Has different distributions
  * Uses different formulas
  * Gives different conclusions
* Estimation
  * Point Estimate: A single value to estimate a parameter
    * In a continuous distribution, the confidence is 0
  * Interval Estimation: Gives a range
    * Can have confidence of varying probabilities
* Calculating
  * $C = 100(1-\alpha)$
  * $\alpha$ is the tail probability outside the interval
  * Two formulas:
    * Ideal Conditions
      * Data comes from SRS or Random Experiment
      * $\sigma$ must be known (population standard deviation)
      * Must be normal (or big n)
        * Do a QQ plot and assume your sample is representative
    * Practical Conditions (If we don't know $\sigma$)
      * Data must still come from SRS or random experiment
      * Population distribution must be approximately normal (n doesn't matter)
  * Margin of error (MOE) +- = critical value (CV) * standard error (SE)
