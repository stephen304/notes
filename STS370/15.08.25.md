# Probability
* We do random experiments when we don't know what's going to happen all the time
* We use probability to determine how likely an outcome is to match what we expect
* Terms
  * Sample Space (_**S**_): Set of all possible outcomes
  * Probability Model: The sample space + the probability of each element of the sample space
  * Event: The outcome of interest, may be a single element or multiple elements of S
    * Simple Event: Single elements
    * Compound Event: Multiple elements
* Random Variables
  * Continuous: Uncountable infinity
  * Discrete: Countable infinity
* Notation:
  * Events: Upper-case letters
  * Elements: Lower-case letters with subscripts ($a_1, a_2...$)
  * Probability: $P(E)$
* Probability Rules
  * $P(S) = 1$
  * $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
  * $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$ (The Complement Rule)
  * $P(A|B) = {P(A \cap B) \over P(B)}$ (Probability of A given B)
  * $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$ (Additive Rule)
  * $P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) * P(B)$ (General Multiplicative Rule)
  * $P(A \cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$ (Multiplicative Rule for Independent Events)
* Independent Events
  * When the outcome of one event doesn't change the probability of the second
  * You can test for independence by using the Multiplicative Rule for Independent Events
* Example:
  * $A = {5, 6}$
  * $B = {2, 4, 6}$
  * $D = {1, 2, 3}$
  * Then:
    * $P(B|A) = {1\over2}$ - Independent because they don't influence each other
    * $P(B|D) = {1\over3}$ - Dependent because D changed D's probability
* Disjoint / Mutually Exclusive: No elements in common
  * If A & B are disjoint, $A \cap B = \{\}\ or\ \emptyset$
