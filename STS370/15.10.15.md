# Hypothesis Test Example
* Determine if the connector pull off force is under 25N
  * $\sigma = 5N$
  * $n = 16$
  * $\bar{x} = 23$
* [P] Let $\mu$ be the true mean connector pull off force
* [H] Hypotheses
  * $H_0: \mu \geq 25$
  * $H_1: \mu \lt 25$
* [A] Conditions:
  * ✔️ SRS or Random Experiment
  * ✔️ Sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ is normal
  * ✔️ We know $\sigma$
* [N] Z-test for a single mean
* [T] $Z =$
  * ${\bar{x} - \mu_0 \over {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}}}$
  * ${23-25 \over {5 \over \sqrt{16}}}$
  * $1.6$
  * P-Value: $P(Z \leq -1.6) = 0.0548$
* Conclusion:
  * There is insignificant evidence in this sample that the true mean connector pull-off force is less than 25N
