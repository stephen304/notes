# Probability Distributions for Continuous RV
* Has an uncountable number of outcomes
* Has a Probability Distribution Function (PDF)
* Properties
  * $f(y) \geq 0$
  * Total area is 1
  * Integrate from a to b to get probability between
  * Single outcomes have probability of 0
* Average value: Integrate then divide by the interval
