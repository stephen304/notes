# Parts of a CPU
* CPU Registers
  * Some allocated for temporary storage
  * General Purpose: Available to programmers
  * Varies widely from architecture to architectures
* ALU: Arithmetic and Logic Unit
  * Adders, inverters, boolean operators, maybe multiplication or division
* Instruction Decode Unit
  * Fetches the next instruction
  * Updates instruction address register to point to the instruction that needs to be executed
  * Decodes the instruction
    * Figures out what the instruction is
    * Finds the relevant data at the Effective Address
  * Passes on to E-unit
* Execution Unit
  * Has control logic for every instruction
* CISC vs RISC
  * CISC: lots of instructions
    * Variable execution time
  * RISC : Lean simple instruction set
    * Fixed execution time
* Buses and Protocols
  * Address Bus
    * Unidirectional
    * Tells memory what it wants
  * 32/64 bit
    * Address space
  * Data Bus
    * Carries data between CPU and memory
    * 8 lines = 1 byte
  * Addr Valid Line
    * Sets to 1 when there is work for memory
  * Read Write
    * 0 means read, 1 means write
  * Clock Line
    * Times things with a square sine wave
  * Steps:
    * Put address on address bus
    * Set R/W
    * Set Addr Valid to 1
    * Memory puts data on Data Bus
    * CPU removes data
    * Set Addr Valid to false
