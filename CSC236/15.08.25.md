# Unsigned Number Systems
* Overflow Errors in the Wild
  * Windows 98 uptime counter used an unsigned number to count milliseconds
    * Caused a crash after 49 days
  * Job listing site overflowed with number of available jobs
* Positional Number Systems
  * Positions represented by the base raised to a power
  * Value = Coefficient * Base^Place + Rest
* Converting Binary <-> Decimal
  * BIN -> DEC Expansion of Powers: Using the value of the base^place and multiplying by the number in the position
  * DEC -> BIN Reduction of Powers: Finding largest base^place and subtracting
* Computer Number Systems
  * Used to be analog
    * Used ranges of voltages to represent numbers - error prone
  * Now computers use on or off
  * Subtraction
    * Uses the same hardware as addition
    * Not optimized
  * Overflows
    * We normally think with infinite digits, we create more as we need them
    * On computers, the number of digits is set by the manufacturer
    * Numbers overflow when the data doesn't fit in the number of digits the computer has
