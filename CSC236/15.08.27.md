# Signed Number Systems
* Operations on signed and unsigned numbers are much more complex
* Mixed Sign Operations
  * Same Sign
    * Add digits
    * Use same sign
  * Different Magnitudes
    * Subtract smaller from larger
    * Take sign of larger
  * Same Magnitude
    * 0
* Signed Binary
  * First digit represents the sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative)
  * To do operations (One's Complement)
    * Invert all the bits
    * Do the operation
      * Carry moves to ones
    * Flip all bits to get the magnitude
  * Two's Complement
    * $N + TC(N) = 2^d$
    * N = Any Number
    * TC(N) = -N
    * d = Number of digits used
    * Shortcut: flip_bits + 1
      * Follows that flip_bits $+ 1 = 2^d - N$
    * Detecting Overflow
      * Intuitive way: If you add 2 same-sign numbers and the result is negative
      * Mathematical way: If the carry out isn't the same as the carry in
