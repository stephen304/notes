# 8086 / DOS
* Memory mapped I/O - Allows programs to communicate with hardware
* Creating programs:
  * Create a .asm file with instructions
  * Use the assembler to make .lst and .obj
  * Use linker to generate .exe
* Assembler
  * label: opcode dest,source ;comment
  * Numbers are decimal by default, use h to specify hex, precede with 0
  * Instructions:
    * mov: copies, doesn't set condition code, can't move between variables
    * name: create variable (name db/dw val)
    * add/sub: sub dest,source -> dest -= dest, sets the condition code
* Start of an Assembly Program:
  * ideal - prompts for clarification
  * model small
  * .p8086 - instruction set
  * .stack 256
  * .data - The data section
  * .code - start of the code
  * start: - start label
    * mov ax,@data
    * mov ds,ax - Initialize the segment registers
  * exit:
    * mov ax,4c00h
    * int 21h
    * end start
* Casting:
  * mov al,[a] - Move to a register
  * cbw - only uses al and ah
* Extra instructions:
  * inc, dec, cwd
