# Multiply and Divide
* Multiply
  * Needs 2 paths for signed and unsigned
    * mul for unsigned
    * imul for signed
  * With x and y digits, the result can be up to x+y digits
  * 2 behaviors for data tyles
    * byte: uses al, stores in ax
    * word: uses ax, stores in dx ax
  * CF says whether the result filled the upper half of the result
* Divide:
  * div val
    * ax divided by byte
  * ah = remainder (takes the sign of the dividend)
  * ax = quotient
  * Overflow if quotient is greater than a byte or if the divisor is greater than the high part of the dividend
