# Inter Process Communication
* Two Methods
  * Message Passing
  * Shared Memory
* Direct Communication
  * send(P0, message)
  * recv(P1, message)
* Indirect Communication
  * send(A, message)
  * recv(A, message)
  * Signals
  * Pipes
    * Creates 2 file descriptors
    * Child and parent process should close unneeded ends of the pipe
    * Buffered (64kb)
    * Byte stream
  * Message Queues
    * Configurable buffer size and message max size
    * Message boundaries respected
* Design Parameters
  * Messages are buffered by the OS
  * Both processes agree to communicate by using send and recv
* Blocking/Non Blocking IPC
  * Blocking is implemented by a queue of PCBs
  * Use polling with a non-blocking call
  * Use upcalls
  * Rendezvous: Sender and receiver wait for handoff
* IPC Buffering
  * Varying sizes
  * Bounded or Unbounded
* Shared Memory
  * Don't need explicit calls
  * Write and read into shared memory
