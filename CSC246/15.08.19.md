# Role of the OS
* Don't programs want them running directly on hardware
  * Would be architecture specific
  * Programs would fight over resources
* OS Mediates
  * Virtualizes resources
  * Provides a consistent interface
  * Allows resource sharing

# System Calls
* The interface to the OS
* Libraries can wrap system calls to make them easier to use

# Hardware
* CPU
  * Executes sequences of machine code
  * Registers (General and Special)
  * Multiple Cores
* Storage
  * Registers > Cache > Main Memory > Disks
  * Each level can cache the next
  * Caching Terms
    * Cache Hit: information was in a cache
    * Cache Miss: information wasn't in a cache
    * Temporal Locality: Cache recently accessed items
    * Spatial Locality: Cache nearby data
  * Caching Policy
    * Write-through: Update main memory on writes
    * Write-back: Update main memory when cache clears
* I/O
  * CPU communicates with device controllers
    * Uses registers to communicate
    * CPU reads and writes to device controller registers
  * Modes
    * Isolated I/O: Special instructions for I/O
    * Memory-Mapped: Read and write to a chunk of memory to communicate
* Interrupts
  * Notifies the CPU that a device controller needs something
  * Perks
    * Better than polling
    * Can catch bad behavior
  * How?
    * Causes the CPU to jump to the interrupt handler
    * Returns to normal execution afterwards
  * OS has multiple interrupts for different types of events
* Using Hardware Through the OS
  * Program/OS: System Call / Upcall
  * OS/Hardware: Command / Interrupt
* Direct Memory Access (DMA)
  * Access between device controller and main memory
  * Uses an interrupt on completion to notify the CPU
* Hardware Protection
  * Programs must share resources
  * Partition resources for safety
  * Dual Mode Operation
    * Kernel Mode
      * CPU can use all instructions & registers
    * User Mode
      * Restricted set of features & instructions
    * Uses a bit to keep track of the mode
      * Switches when an interrupt is triggered
      * Switches when a system call is made by a program - uses a trap
      * Switches back to previous mode when interrupt handlers finish
