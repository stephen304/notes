# Process Switching
* Gaps between running processes are due to kernel and interrupts
  * Task switching overhead
* Process Control Block (PCB)
  * Record for each running process
  * Stored in Kernel Memory
  * Contains:
    * Process state
      * New
      * Ready
      * Running
      * Waiting
      * Terminated
    * PID (maybe parent PID too)
    * Register backups
    * Memory bounds
    * Resources in use
    * Pointers for linked list of PCBs
  * Linked into queues:
    * Ready Queue
    * Device Queue
    * Kernel moves PCBs among these queues
* Schedulers
  * Short term: Decide which one to do next
  * Long term: When to add jobs
  * Disk scheduler
