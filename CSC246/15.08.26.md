# System Boot
* Needs to load the kernel into memory and start system programs
* Boot Sequence
  * Start firmware at fixed address
  * Load bootstrap loader from secondary storage
  * Copy kernel and execute it
  * Kernel initializes data structures (interrupt vectors)
  * Kernel starts init system

# OS Design
* Resources used to be scarce
  * One program at a time
  * Less hardware protection
* Multi Tasking
  * Keeping multiple programs in memory
  * Sharing resources (CPU time)
  * Better hardware protection needed
* Early OS:
  * Kernel: File system, cpu scheduling, kernel mode programs
  * System Programs: Lets users interact with the system
* Layered Approach
  * Organize components in layers
  * Limits hardware exposure
  * Reduce the amount of code in kernel mode
* Microkernel
  * From the layered approach
  * Most programs in userspace
  * More secure
* Modular Kernel
  * Similar to Microkernel
  * Kernel Module
    * Object oriented approach
    * Modules loadable during kernel execution

# Processes
* Abstraction for a running program
* Has a protected region of memory
* Has the privileges of the user who created it
* OS Process Management
  * Creates / Destroys / Queries process state
  * Provides Inter Process Communications (IPC)
* CPU Sharing
  * Uses interrupts
  * Sometimes returns back to the same process, sometimes switches processes
  * Called context switching
    * Saves a copy of the CPU registers
    * Sets new memory bounds
    * Restores new processes registers
* Types:
  * CPU I/O Burst Cycle: Runs then waits
  * CPU-Bound Processes: Longer CPU bursts
  * I/O-Bound Processes: Spends more time doing I/O
* Process Creation
  * Tree of Processes
  * Children inherit some resources (open files)
* Process Termination
  * When parents exit, children can continue
  * Processes can terminate each other
