# Scheduling
* Metrics:
  * Average Turnaround Time: Total time to finish over number of processes
  * Average Wait Time: Total time to start over total number of processes
* First come first served (FCFS)
  * Fast, low overhead
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
  * Non-pre-emptive
  * Best non-pre-emptive scheduler
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  * Takes CPU away from long bursts when short bursts arrive
* How to predict the future?
  * Uses an exponential average to guesstimate
  * Weights the history less than the most recent bursts
* Priority:
  * Smallest priority is more important
  * Priorities can be computed
* Round Robin (RR)
  * Processes taking turns
  * Time Quantum - Time per turn (10-100 milliseconds)
  * Vary quantum length to balance context switching overhead and responsiveness
    * Long quantum behaves more like FCFS
* Real Time Processes
  * Get priority over regular processes
* Multilevel Queue Scheduling
  * Makes queues depending on process type
  * Ex. foreground and background jobs
  * Feedback: Processes can move between queues depending on behavior
* Multi-processor Scheduling
  * Homogeneous / Heterogeneous - Treating all cores equivalent
  * Asymmetric multiprocessing - Using one cpu to manage scheduling
  * Symmetric multiprocessing - Load sharing
  * Processor affinity - Tries to keep threads / processes on the same core / cpu
* Contention Scope: Whether threads compete with other processes or just each other
