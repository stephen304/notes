# Scheduling
* Metrics:
  * Average Turnaround Time: Total time to finish over number of processes
  * Average Wait Time: Total time to start over total number of processes
* First come first served (FCFS)
  * Fast, low overhead
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
  * Non-pre-emptive
  * Best non-pre-emptive scheduler
* Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
  * Takes CPU away from long bursts when short bursts arrive
* How to predict the future?
  * Uses an exponential average to guesstimate
  * Weights the history less than the most recent bursts
* Priority:
  * Smallest priority is more important
  * Priorities can be computed
