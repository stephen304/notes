# Chapter 7: Memory
* Affected by different factors
  * Similarity
  * Characteristics of info
  * Method of testing
  * Passage of time
  * Distinctiveness (racism)
  * Meaningfulness
* Types of memories
  * Declarative: Facts
    * Semantic: What
    * Episodic: Circumstances
  * Procedural: How do do something

## History
* Ebbinghaus pioneered studies of memory
* Similarity of information reduces memory effectiveness
  * Interference
  * Made up new "words" to reduce interference

## Testing methods
* Recall (free recall) - Just recall info
* Cued recall - Person is given hints

## Working memory
* Phonological Loop
  * Stores and repeats speech information
* Visuospatial Sketchpad
  * Stores and manipulates visual and spatial information
* Central Executive
  * Governs shifts of attention
  * Working memory handles shifts between tasks

## Long-term memory
* Relatively permanent
* No known limits
* No decay rate
* Retrieval is hindered by
  * Interference
  * Loss of retrieval cues

## Transfer from short term to long term
* Originally thought to be "consolidation", taking time
* Holding information in short term memory has little relation to encoding into long term memory
* Meaningfulness is the largest factor to encoding information into long term memory.

## Memory Errors
* Hindsight Bias
  * We reconstruct memories based on what we think happened
* Clinical memory reconstruction
  * Can be accurate or inaccurate
