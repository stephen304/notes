# Ch13: Social Psychology
* How people influence and are influenced by each other
* Topics:
  * Perceptions
  * Attitudes and persuasion
  * All behaviors of relatively normal people
* Social perception and Cognition
  * Perception - Collecting information
  * Cognition - interpreting the information
  * Attribution: Assigning causes to others' behaviors
    * Internal - Attributed to internal factors (Low consensus)
    * External - Situational, from external factors (High consensus)
    * We decide using:
      * Consensus - We decide on the attribution depending on other's behavior
      * Consistency information (across time) - If the person behaves inconsistently
      * Distinctiveness (across situations) - More variability lends itself to external attribution
  * Correspondence bias
    * We make more internal attributions for other people
    * Make more external attributions for ourselves
    * Can be switched around if we watch ourselves
    * This helps us maintain a positive self-image
      * We also make more internal attributions for success and external attribution for failure
      * Self handicapping strategies - prepare an excuse for poor performance
* Attitude:
  * 3 components
    * Affect - Emotions, how you feel
    * Cognitive - What you believe as a fact
    * Behavioral - What yu will do about it
  * Likert scales (strongly disagree <-> strongly agree)
    * The more familiar you are, the more accurate your response
  * Persuasion
    * An attempt to change someone's behavior or attitude
    * Two types:
      * Central route - Persuasion that relates directly
      * Peripheral route - Persuasion that has nothing to do with the subject, attractiveness, professionalism, authoritativeness
    * Variables that affect persuasion
      * Personal relevance - The more relevant the topic is, the better central route works
      * Intelligence
      * Mood - Happier mood causes peripheral route to work better
    * Persuasive techniques
      * Foot in the door - Smaller request is followed by a larger request
      * Door in the face - Larger request followed by a small request succeeds more often
      * Bait and switch
      * That's not all
      * Perceived similarity - If the persuader is like you
      * Group endorsement
      * Fear
      * Forewarning effect - Lower expectations
      * Inoculation Effect - Use strong arguments first
      * The sleeper effect - Source amnesia
      * Minority influence - Influences the majority
  * Cognitive dissonance
    * When we realize we behaved inconsistently with our attitude
    * We change our attitude to compensate
* Normality
  * No definite normal
  * Mental health diagnoses
    * When problems seriously interfere with their lives
  * Medical Students' Disease
    * Medical students start to believe that they have diseases they are studying
    * Self diagnosing
  * Abnormal Behavior defined by APA as
    * Causing distress to others
    * Disabling or impairing functions
    * Increasing risk of death, pain, or freedom
  * Psychotherapy
    * Counseling / coaching
    * Therapy / psychoactive medications for those with diagnoses
