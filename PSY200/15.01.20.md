# Statistics in Psychological Research
* Use statistics to determine how significant results are

* Descriptive
  * Measurements of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
  * Measurements of variation (variance, dispersion)
    * Range
    * Standard deviation
* Inferential
  * Probability values (p values): Probability that the difference between populations is due to chance (<.05)
  *Sattistically significant / reliable when there is high correlation and low p values
  * Confidence intervals
    * An interval that probably contains the true effect of a variable
