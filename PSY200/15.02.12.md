# Chapter 6: Learning Part 2
* Learning Curve
  * Improvements of completing a task related to repetitive trials
  * Behavior probabilities change over the course of the experiment because of reinforcements
* Extinction:
  * Behavior loses its predictive value if it doesn't trigger the response
* Terms:
  * Positive/negative reinforcement
  * Primary reinforcers (Needs like food)
  * Secondary reinforcer (learned, money)
  * Schedule of reinforcement
    * Continuous - Always reinforcement
    * Intermittent - Sometimes reinforcement
      * Ratio (eg 30%, fixed or variable) or interval (eg every hour)
