# Biological Psychology
## Divisions of the nervous system
* Central nervous system: Brain + Spinal cord
* Peripheral nervous system: Bundles of axions between the spinal cord and the rest of the body
  * Somatic nervous system
    * Sensory: inward
    * Motor: outward
  * Autonomic nervous system (Unconscious control)
    * Sympathetic system (left/right of spinal cord)
      * Uses lots of energy
      * Pupils constrict, saliva decreases, pulse quickens, sweat, stomach activity decreases, adrenaline
      * Fight or flight
    * Parasympathetic system (base/top of spinal cord)
      * Conserves energy
      * Pupils constrict, saliva flows, pulse slows, stomach activity increases
    * Work together to maintain homeostasis

## Neurons
* Cell body: Nucleus, bulk of the cell
* Dendrites: Receive input from other cells
* Axon: Carries outbound information, to other neurons or muscles/organs/etc
  * Some coated with myelin sheath

## Nerve impulses
* Action potentials: electrochemical signals
  * Either excitatory or inhibitory
  * All or none: no half measures
  * Slowed down compared to electrical conduction
* Resting potential
  * Sodium/Potassium gates maintain a charge balance when resting
* Action potential
  * When more exitatory signals are received, the neuron fires
  * The charge flows as gates change the charge difference of the cell
* Synapses operate purely chemically

## Imaging the Brain
* CT or CAT scanning shows the brain structure, not activity
* PET or fMRI shows brain activity
* EEC shows activity levels but not location

## Experience and the Brain
* Experience changes the brain
  * The brain adapts when tissue dies - Other areas adapt to pick up the slack
* Binding Problem
  * How does the brain put together all the information that it receives at the same time?

## Hemispheres of the Brain
* Right hemisphere needs to communicate with the left to name objects
* Left hemisphere needs the right to synthesize parts of an image together
