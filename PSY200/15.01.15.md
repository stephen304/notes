# Scientific Methods in Psychology
* Use proof and disproof
* Needs to be replicable
* Use induction or deduction to form hypotheses

## Observational vs Experimental Study Design
* Observational doesn't interfere
  * Can't establish causation
* Experimental is more effective

## Operational Definitions
* Basically defining abstract terms to allow objectively quantifying them
* Finding a way to attach a number to abstract terms

## Scientific Theories
* A comprehensive explanation of observable events and conditions
* Must be concise, consistent, and make few assumptions (parsimony)
* Must be falsifiable

## Anecdotal Evidence
* Confirmatory bias
* Isolated events

## Sample Populations
* It's difficult to sample every test subject
* Use sample sizes to represent the whole populaton
* Sampling methods
  * Random
  * Convenience
* Sample types
  * Representative - Little or no error
  * Cross-Cultural - At least 2 distinct cultures

## Research Designs
* Observational:
  * Naturalistic Observation
  * Case Studies
  * Surveys
  * Correlational Studies
    * Relates 2 variables with a correlation coefficient
    * Correlation coefficient (r) can be from -1 to 1
    * Correlation is not causation
  * Experiments are studies that manipulates variables
    * Manipulates the independent variable
    * It controls the dependent variable
    * Control group / treanment or experimental group
    * Validity
      * External validity: Do the findings apply to everyone outside of the experiment
        * Get better sample population
      * Internal validity: Successfully rule out other explanations
        * Use single blind or double blind
