# Descartes
* Father of modern philosophy
* Invented cartesian coordinate system
* Wanted to get rid of all his false beliefs
  * To throw out all the beliefs that are doubtable
    * (sun orbits around the earth)
  * Wanted to start at the beginning to week out false beliefs
  * This is a process of doubt (method of doubt)
* We trust people who are reliable: who have a good reputation
* All his beliefs come from senses and other people's senses
  * Senses aren't completely reliable
  * How do you know you aren't dreaming?
  * Certain things have to be real
  * Evil Demon Scenario
    * Feeding you experiences
    * Only you and evil demon exists
    * You can doubt everything including:
      * Events
      * Objects
      * Physical Properties (color, shapes, space, logic and math)
    * Things that we can't doubt:
      * I think, therefore I am
    * Descartes is wrong - how do you know you are thinking?
      * Memories of thinking could be false
  * Skepticism
  * Descartes leaves skepticism
    * Argument:
      * God exists
      * God isn't a deceiver

    * Problems:
      * Premises 1 and 2 are weak
