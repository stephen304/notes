# Berkeley and Locke
* The "vulgar" believe in naive realism
  * This doesn't allow for hallucinations or dreams or optical illusions
* The veil of perception - The gap between the object and it's perception in our mind
* Locke's view:
  * The qualities of the object transfer to the image in our mind
  * Primary qualities are real (shape, dimensions, solidity, motion)
    * We get real information about these
  * Secondary qualities are ideas to us (color, sound, taste, smell)
  * We can readily change secondary qualities
* Berkley's view:
  * Denies the existence of matter
    * No reason to believe it exists
    1. Neither primary or secondary qualities are real
    2. Primary qualities don't resemble the objects
    * Both types of qualities can differ depending on the observer
  * Believes that ideas only resemble other ideas
    * Both ideas need to be present to compare them
  * Thus, Locke's view is back in skepticism
  * Objects are ideas - abstractions of ideas generated by reason
  * God causes the ideas in our minds (kind of like evil demon)
