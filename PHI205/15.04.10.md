# Philosophy of Science
* How does science get us knowledge?
* Parts of science:
  * Theories / explanations - tell what the world is like
  * Experiments / observations to ensure we got the theories right
* Types of reasoning:
  * Inductive - Builds general laws by looking at many cases and generalizing
    * Sometimes uses best explanation
  * Deductive - Make predictions from general laws and check them
    * They explain phenomena by showing that they derive from laws and conditions
* Hume's problem of induction
  * We are assuming that things in the past are representative of how things will be in the future
  * Habit of mind
  * We set aside this problem - otherwise we wouldn't get anywhere
* Carl Hempel
  * Deductive-nomological
    * A lot of scientific work uses deductive reasoning
    * Prediction: To test laws
    * Explanation: After testing hypotheses, scientists use laws to explain
    * Called deductive-nomological method
    * Example:
      * We need to explain planetary motion
      * Find relevant laws:
        * Laws of motion
      * Find relevant conditions:
        * Planetary position
        * Position of other bodies
    * Deductive-nomological = deductive laws
    * Use laws and conditions as premises in a deductive argument
    * Problems:
      * Not everything can be derived from laws
      * Math can be rearranged - which side explains which?
  * Hypothetico-Deductive
    * Test a hypothesis by deriving predictions if the hypothesis is true
      * Hypothesis 1
      * Hypothesis 2
      * Condition 1
      * Condition 2
      * Therefore - expected outcome P
    * If the experiment results match the prediction, the hypothesis is confirmed
    * Problems:
      * Confirmation happens when the hypothesis is confirmed
      * Still inductive
      * Predictions need to be valid
    * Solutions:
      * Make science about disproving hypotheses - solves confirmation problem
      * Corroborate, don't confirm
