# Introduction to logic
## Arguments
* "A connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition"
  * Requires a proposition / assertion / **conclusion**
  * Needs supporting statements / reasons / **premises**
  * Premises and conclusion must be connected
  * Not throwing :shit:

## Identifying an argument
* Sometimes it's obvious that someone is trying to convince you of something
* Clues for identifying an argument via argument words
  * Before Premises
    * Since
    * Because
  * Before conclusion
    * Therefore
    * Then
    * So
    * Thus
    * Probably
* If-Then structures make a conditional assertion
  * Counts as an argument as long as it has premises
* An optinion without premises is no argument
* The writer must stand behind the view being presented

## Standard form for arguments
    1. Premise
    2. Premise
    ...
    Therefore, conclusion

* Standard form helps make arguments clear

## Evaluating arguments
* 2 kinds of arguments:
  * Deductive arguments
    * Establishes the conclusion with certainty
    * If the premises are true, the conclusion has to be true
    * Mortal socrates
  * Inductive arguments
    * Establishes the conclusion with only a certain probability
    * Making generalizations

## How to make a good argument
* Deductive arguments
  * Sound
    * Technically valid
  * Valid when:
    * If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true
    * Is the reasoning valid
* Inductive arguments
  * Can be good or strong
  * The rules depend on the kind of inductive argument
