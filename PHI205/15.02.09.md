## Arguments Against the Existence of God
* The Problem of Evil
  * If there is God, why is there evil
    * God knows of all bad things
    * God is all powerful
    * God hates bad things
    * The things God doesn't want to happen still happen
  * What is Evil?
    * Moral Evil: Caused by actions of humans
    * Natural Evil: Caused by nature - without choices
  * Problems with the argument:
    * Free will can be a greater good than stopping all evil
    * Maybe there is a reason for evil that we don't / can't know
    * Evil could be a side effect of a natural system (having a natural system is a greater good)
    * Evil is temporary
    * Evil creates purpose / is a test
