# Virtue Ethics
* Aristotle
* Based on being a "good person"
* Evaluates character to decide who is good
  * What does a good person do?
  * Eg. look for generous people not generous actions
* Virtue ethics gives a broader ethical vocabulary - not just good or bad
* Virtues
  * Just
  * Kind
  * Prudence
  * Patience
* Virtue ethics is a bit circular
  * You decide who is virtuous to determine what acts are virtuous so you can decide who else is virtuous
* Problems
  * Virtues are highly subjective
    * Argued that something is a virtue if it helps achieve the goods inherent to a practice
  * Doesn't resolve virtue conflict
