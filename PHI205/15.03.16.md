# Political Philosophy
* Definition of a good society
* Justice, Fairness, and Equality
  * Make sure there are courts
  * Does justice = fairness?
* How to assign good / rights / opportunities / liberties

# Hobbes vs. Locke
* How is society formed?
* State of nature - Before government or society
  * Why do they go from state of nature to government
  * State of equality

## Hobbes
* Humans are equal
* We want the same things
* We would be in danger all the time because of competition
* Natural Law / Natural Right
  * Everybody has the rights to everything
* Right of Nature
  * The right to do what it takes to survive
* Can agree to not kill each other - to leave state of nature
  * By giving up the 1 right to everything
  * Forms a social contract
  * Except nobody enforces the contract
    * Leviathan - We would accept a power capable of enforcing the social contracts
    * Enforcer grants more rights
    * Can't complain

## Locke
* Also starts with equality
* Unless God enforces a hierarchy - make a king (diving rights)
* Right of Nature
  * Must do what it takes to survive
  * Can't hurt anybody else
* Rights derived from equality
* Instead of leviathan, people are the enforcers
