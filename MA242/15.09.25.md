# 11.7 Max and Min
* If we have $f(x, y)$, we derive and set =0
  * These points are critical or stationary points
* In 2D:
  * Use the second derivative (concavity) to determine if it's a local min or max
* In 3D:
  * If $D(a,b) > 0$
    * If $f_{xx}(a,b) < 0$ local max
    * If $f_{xx}(a,b) > 0$ local min
  * If $D(a,b) < 0$ - Saddle point
  * If $D(a,b) = 0$ - inconclusive
* Concepts:
  * Given a shape S, P is a point on the shape
  * P is interior if there is a dick with center P contained in A
  * P is boundary if every disk with center P contains area outside of S
  * A is a closed set if the boundaries are included in the set
  * If A is closed, any continuous functions have absolute max and min
