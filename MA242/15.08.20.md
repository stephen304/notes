# Vectors
* Direction and magnitude
* Location doesn't change a vector
* Vocab
  * Tail / Initial Point: The origin of the vector
  * Terminal Point / End Point: The tip of the vector
* Noted by $\vec{AB}$ or sometimes **v**
* ### Vector Addition
  * Added by joining the tails to the tips
    * $\vec{AB} + \vec{BC} = \vec{AC}$
    * (Triangle Law)
  * This combines the components
  * It doesn't matter which vectors are added first
    * (Parallelogram Law)
  * Doubling a vector simply doubles the magnitude
    * Each component is doubled
* ### Magnitude of a vector
  * Denoted by $|v|$, which is a scalar
  * Reversed by $-v$
  * These cancel out (0 vector)
* ### Properties
  * $u + v = v + u$
  * $u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$
  * $v + \vec{0} = v$
  * $v + (-v) = \vec{0}$
  * $c (u + v) = cu + cv$
  * $(c + d) v = cv + dv$
  * $(cd) v = c (dv)$
  * $1v = v$
