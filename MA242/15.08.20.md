# Vectors
* Direction and magnitude
* Location doesn't change a vector
* Vocab
  * Tail / Initial Point: The origin of the vector
  * Terminal Point / End Point: The tip of the vector
* Noted by $\vec{AB}$ or sometimes **v**
* ### Vector Addition
  * Added by joining the tails to the tips
    * $\vec{AB} + \vec{BC} = \vec{AC}$
    * (Triangle Law)
  * This combines the components
  * It doesn't matter which vectors are added first
    * (Parallelogram Law)
  * Doubling a vector simply doubles the magnitude
    * Each component is doubled
* ### Magnitude of a vector
  * Denoted by $|v|$, which is a scalar
  * Reversed by $-v$
  * These cancel out (0 vector)
* ### Properties
  * $u + v = v + u$
  * $u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w$
  * $v + \vec{0} = v$
  * $v + (-v) = \vec{0}$
  * $c (u + v) = cu + cv$
  * $(c + d) v = cv + dv$
  * $(cd) v = c (dv)$
  * $1v = v$
* Unit vector ($u$):
  * Points in the same direction as a vector
  * Has a length of 1
  * Find by dividing a vector's components by it's total length
    * $u = {1\over|v|} * v = {v\over|v|}$
  * Physics:
    * Use i, j, k (Standard Basis)
    * Unit vectors
    * i->x, j->y, k->z
    * $\vec{i} = <1,0,0>, \vec{j} = <0,1,0>, \vec{k}=<0,0,1>$
    * Use these vectors to express other vectors
      * eg. $xi + yj + zk$

# Examples (9.1)
* Triangle inequality: Add the distance of AB to BC, if it equals AC, the points are on a straight line
  * This works in 3D too
  * $A(2, 4, 2)$
  * $B(3, 7, -2)$
  * $C(1, 3, 3)$
  * $|AB| = \sqrt{(2-3)^2 + (4-7)^2 + (2-(-2))^2} = \sqrt{26}$
  * $|BC| = \sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (7-3)^2 + (-2-3)^2} = \sqrt{45}$
  * $|AC| = \sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (4-3)^2 + (2-3)^2} = \sqrt{3}$
  * Not a straight line
* When working with spheres, make a solid sphere with $ \leq r $
  * Sphere formula:
  * $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0^2) + (z-z_0)^2 = r^2$
  * $x_0, y_0, z_0$ = Origin

# Examples (9.2)
* $v=\vec{OP}$ is the position vector of the point $P$ (O is the origin)
  * $v = <x_1, y_1>$
    * $u = \vec{OA} = <x_1, y_1>$
    * $w = \vec{OB} = <x_2, y_2>$
  * $\vec{OA} + \vec{AB} = \vec{OB}$
  * $u + v = w$
  * $v = w - u = w + (-u)$
  * wut?
  * Gives you the vector $\vec{OP}$ even though V (A and B) were not at the origin
* In 3D
  * 2 points
  * $A(x_1, y_1, z_1)$
  * $B(x_2, y_2, z_2)$
  * $\vec{AB}$ length is $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 + (z_1-z_2)^2}$
  * If we have vector $\vec{OP} = <x_3, y_3, z_3>$, Then $x_3, y_3, z_3$ are the differences between the 2 points' $x, y, z$
