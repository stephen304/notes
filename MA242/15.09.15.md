# 11.2 Limits of Functions of Multiple Variables
* $f(x, y)$ has a limit $L$ as $(x, y)$ approaches $(a, b)$
* All paths must give the same limit, otherwise the function has no limit
* Limit Properties
  * $lim(f+g) = lim(f) + lim(g)$
  * $lim(cf) = c*lim(f)$
  * $lim(fg) = lim(f) * lim(g)$
* In order to find the limit ad a point approaches 0, use mx instead of x
