# 3D Coordinate Systems
* 2D coordinate system has 2 degrees of freedom
* In 3D, x is normally on the left and y is on the right
* A 2-axis plane can be given by the third dimension being constant
  * eg. yz plane is $x=0$
  * Other planes can be $x=6$ or $z=6$
  * Changing the constant yields parallel planes
* An can be represented by the 2 other dimensions being constant
  * eg. z-axis is $x=y=0$
* Distance In 2D
  * Given by $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}$
  * Given that, a circle is $(x_1-y_1)^2+(y_1-y_2)^2 = r^2$
    * Radius is $r$ and center is $(x_1, y_1)$
* Distance In 3D
  * Given by $\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 + (z_1-z_2)^2}$
  * So a sphere is $(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2 + (z_1-z_2)^2 = r^2$
    * Where radius is $r^2$ and center is $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$
* Taking 2D equations into 3D
  * Figure extrudes along the unrestricted axis
  * Circle -> Cylinder
    * Add in $z \geq 0$ and it chops the cylinder off below 0
* Quadrants / Octants
  * In 2D eg. $x > 0$, $y > 0$
  * In 3D eg. $x > 0$, $y > 0$, $z > 0$

# Example
* $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 4x - 6y + 2z + 6 = 0$
  * $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$
