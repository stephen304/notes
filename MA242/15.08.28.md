# Lines and Planes in 3D
* Find a line going through a point and is parallel to a certain vector
  * Point $P_0(x_0, y_0, z_0)$
  * Vector $v = <a, b, c>$
  * Find the vector from origin to $P_0$
    * $\vec{r_0} = \vec{OP_0} = <x_0, y_0, z_0>$
  * Point $P$ is on the vector $v$
    * $ \vec{r} = \vec{OP} = <x, y, z>$
  * So $\vec{P_0P} = \vec{OP} - \vec{OP_0} = \vec{r} - \vec{r_0}$
  * Finally, $\vec{r} = \vec{r_0} + t\vec{v}$
    * (Displace to $P_0$ and use a multiple of v to get to $P$)
  * Simplified:
    * $<x_0+ta, y_0+tb, z_0+tc<$
  * Parametric Solution:
    * $x = x_0+ta$
    * $y = y_0+tb$
    * $z = z_0+tc$
  * Removing - t:
    * Assume that a, b, and c are not 0
    * $x-x_0 = ta$
    * $y-y_0 = tb$
    * $z-z_0 = tc$
    * Reorganize: (Symmetric Equations)
    * ${x-x_0 \over a} = {y-y_0 \over b} = {z-z_0 \over c}$
    * If one of a, b, or c is 0, the corresponding x, y, or z is constant
* Example:
  * $P_0(6, 1, -3)$
  * $P_1(2, 4, 5)$
  * So $v = \vec{P_0P_1} = <-4, 3, 8>$
  * Equation is $\vec{r}(t) = \vec{r_0} + t\vec{v} = <6, 1, -3> + t<-4, 3, 8>$
    * $= <6-4t, 1+3t, -3+8t>$
    * $x = 6-4t$
    * $y = 1+3t$
    * $z = -3+8t$
    * Plug into formula
    * ${x-6 \over -4} = {y-1 \over 3} = {z-(-3) \over 8}$
* Find a plane that is perpendicular to a vector containing a point
  * Point $P_0$
  * Vector $\vec{n}$
  * $ax + by + cz + d = 0$
    * Where $<a, b, c>$ is the normal vector
  * Planes are parallel when the normal vectors are parallel
  * The angle between the normal vectors is the angle that the planes intersect at
  * Also, $comp_\vec{n}\vec{b} = {|\vec{n} * \vec{b}| \over |\vec{n}|}$
