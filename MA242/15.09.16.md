# 11.3 Partial Derivatives
* Process:
  * Start with a function of 2 variables
  * We want to see how the function changes as y is fixed to a constant
  * Plug in the fixed variable, you get a function of 1 variable
  * Derive this function to get the partial derivative at the point
* Notation: $g_x$ or $g_1$ or $D_1f$
* Treat the other variable as a constant when finding the indefinite partial derivative

* Geometric Meaning of Partial Derivatives
  * On an xz plane, we have $z=f(x)$
  * The partial derivative is the slope of the function ($f'(a)$)
    * The equation of the tangent line is $z = f(a) + f'(a) (x-a)$
