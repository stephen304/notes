# 11.1 Functions of Several Variables
* $f(x, y)$, for a set of real numbers x and y, given that x and y are in the domain
* Example: $f(x, y) = \sqrt{9-x^2-y^2}$
  * Domain: $x^2 + y^2 \leq 3$
  * Range: $0 \leq f(x, y) \leq 3$
  * Shape: Top half of a sphere
* Functions can be give:
  * Verbally: Describe what it is, domain, range, shapes
  * Numerically: Table of values
  * Algebraically: With a formula
  * Visually: Given the graph / surface
