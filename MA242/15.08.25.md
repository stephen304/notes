# Cross Product
* Cross product of 2 vectors yields another vector
* Exists only in 3D
* Used for Torque
  * $|\vec{t}| = |\vec{r}| \bullet |\vec{F}| \times\sin(\theta)$
* $|\vec{a} \times \vec{b}| = |\vec{a}| \bullet |\vec{b}| \times \sin(\theta)$
  * Direction follows the right hand rule
  * $i \times j = k$
* Cross Product is not commutative, it's anti-commutative
  * $a \times b = -b \times a $
